**Creating Tomorrow’s Blue Print for Public Safety Software and Technology in India**

A major effort is underway in India to modernize policing. Technology and the resulting impacts on operations may be the key to improve public safety across the country. For India’s 29 states to make such a program successful, every state must consider a more modern approach to incident management and response – one that involves streamlining and updating systems, supporting multi-agency collaboration, and committing to improved services. Two Indian states are already leading the way through consolidated call-taking and centralizing dispatching for police services.

Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh recognize that modernization is critical to serving the public safety needs of their respective citizens. To better serve incident response needs in these states, the [Madhya Pradesh Police](http://www.hexagonsafetyinfrastructure.com/case-studies/madhya-pradesh-police-deploys-integrated-suite-of-public-safety-software) and the [Uttar Pradesh Police](http://www.hexagonsafetyinfrastructure.com/case-studies/uttar-pradesh-police-incident-response-integrated-public-safety-sofware) have implemented Hexagon Safety & Infrastructure’s integrated suite of public safety software for emergency call handling, officer dispatch, and incident management and response. Here’s a look at how these innovative law enforcement agencies are using our public safety solutions in similar ways.

Consolidating Emergency Numbers and Command Centers

For the Madhya Pradesh Police and Uttar Pradesh Police, upgrading their respective incident management and response capabilities started with consolidating emergency numbers into one a single number and by centralizing command and control operations. Both agencies rolled out “Dial 100” public awareness campaigns to inform citizens about the single law enforcement emergency number. At the core of each state’s unified command-and-control center is Hexagon’s Intergraph Computer-aided Dispatch (I/CAD) system.

Uttar Pradesh Police, which houses India’s largest police emergency response system, receives and manages an estimated 200,000 calls per day via its emergency hotline services, which include landline, VoIP, SMS, email, social media and mobile application. Madhya Pradesh Police receives and manages an estimated 100,000 call per day at its center. Along with efficiently managing huge call volumes, I/CAD has expanded both agencies’ incident response capabilities through map-based views of calls, events, and units in the field. The system is also able to scale as call volumes expand and contract based on events.
